The outlined system can be very beneficial for companies who use open source software (OSS) frequently. This system will provide developers and managers with the necessary information to make sure that they are following the correct procedures for the licenses attached to their code. Plus, it will also make the developers and managers aware of any vulnerabilities that are known about OSS packages. In the long-term, knowing about licenses and vulnerabilities should help alleviate lawsuits because the company using this system will know about all of the legal issues associated with their OSS.

There are six main functions that this system performs. 1) Developers can search for license and vulnerability info on a new OSS package using the Check for OSS Components process. 2) and 3) Both Developers and Managers can find previously searched for license and vulnerability info using the Obtain License and Vulnerability Info process. 4) Managers can apply new policies to the Policy DB using the Apply New Policies process. 5) Managers can search for existing policies in the Policy DB using the Set/Edit/Find Policies process. 6) Managers can update existing policies in the Policy DB using the Set/Edit/Find Policies process.
